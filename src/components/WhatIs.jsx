                <h2>What is Mutual Aid?</h2>
                <b>A brief education + places to learn more.</b><br /><br />

                Mutual aid projects are a form of political participation in which people take responsibility for caring for one another and changing political conditions. Mutual aid participants work together to figure out strategies and resources to meet each others' needs, such as food, housing, medical care, jail/prison support, and disaster relief, while organizing themselves against the system that created shortages/harm in the first place. A few critical concepts are inside this:
                <br /><br />
                <h3>Mutual Aid vs. Charity</h3>
                Mutual aid projects are distinct from and often critical of charity. Charity is a framework in which public donations are a means for corporations and the wealthy to boost their public image/profits. They get to set the criteria -- e.g. giving only to mothers, to sober people, to religious people, and other "deserving poor" models. In this way, charity participates in a system of strategies for controlling economically disadvantaged populations. It reinforces a lot of the blame that is placed on economically disadvantaged people, including ideas that they need to get sober, need to take parenting classes, need to 'do better'. In reality, poverty is a result of capitalism, and people of color and women are the poorest people because of sexism and racism. 
                <br /><br />
                In recent decades, charity and social services have been privatized and contracted out to what critics call the Non-Profit Industrial Complex. Non-profits compete for grants from corporations or philanthropists to address social problems or serve poor people. This means that rich people and corporations get to decide what strategies should be funded. They also get to protect their money from taxation if they give it out to non-profits. Non-profits are mostly run by rich white people with graduate degrees, they have steep pay scales in which upper class people and white people get paid more, and the people most effected by the issues they claim to address have no say in what they do or how they work.
                <br /><br />
                Mutual aid projects depart from these norms of charity, social services and non-profitization. They often focus on transparency, mutual participation, political education, connection to and solidarity with other mutual aid projects, open meetings and pathways for new people to participate, consensus-based decision making, and humility/willingness to hear feedback.
