Mutual aid participants work together to figure out strategies and resources to meet each others' needs, such as food, housing, medical care, and disaster relief, while organizing themselves against the system that created the shortage in the first place.
                <br /><br />
                Mutual aid projects are distinct from and often critical of charity. While charity differentiates those who have from those who need and puts those who have in a position of power to make decisions about how to meet others' needs, mutual aid is more collaborative.
